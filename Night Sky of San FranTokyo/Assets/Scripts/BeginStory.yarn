Venturing forth, I see a light at the end of the tunnel.
It's... bright.
Arid, hot winds blow through as sand pelts my eyelids.
Will I finally reach that hope that I've been looking for?
Or will it be snatched away all too soon, leaving me in the cold, unforgiving concrete prison as it had done before?
As my feet give way to the sandy textures of the Santa Monica pier, I look up.
...only to find myself staring at the Night Sky of San FranTokyo.
